                <h4>What is JWoC?</h4>
                <p>
                    Hello there! Feeling too old to be a student in JGEC Winter of Code? No problem,
                    you fit in here too! JWoC is about helping students make their first PR (probably)
                    on GitHub, and also gaining the confidence which is required in the future while
                    doing open source.

            <div class="block_grp">
                <h4>Goals of the Program</h4>
                <p>
                    As a mentor, you must know that the major goal of the program is to help new students
                    to understand the paradigm of Open Source contribution and increase their expertise
                    level on Git and GitHub.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="block_grp">
                <h4>Rules & Regulations</h4>
                <h6>You must follow the rules and regulations!</h6>
                <ul class="violet">
                    <li>
                        Prepare a clear and beginner-friendly explanation for the project you are mentoring
                        and add a properly documented README file to your project repo. The details of the
                        project objective and Tech-stack should be clearly mentioned.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On the creation of the respective project channels on discord, all the necessary
                        documentation and learning resources for contribution must be shared. Please ensure
                        that the important links and messages are to be pinned to the channel.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the <b>JWOC</b> tag to all your issues on GitHub. Please use labels with a
                        proper color scheme to differentiate the issues based on their difficulty level
                        and tech-stack/problem tag.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Issues need to be assigned on a First-Come-First-Serve basis and
                        are applicable only when they are opted through GitHub.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each issue needs to be completed within a specific time limit according to its
                        difficulty level (<span>Easy: 1 day</span>, <span>Medium: 2-3 days</span>
                        and <span>Hard: 4 days</span>). If a mentee is unable to solve the allotted
                        issue within the given period, the issue needs to be passed to other contenders
                        on the discretion of the mentor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A mark sheet needs to be maintained by all mentors to tabulate the scores of each
                        participant and needs to be submitted at the end of both Phase 1 and Phase 2.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The projects with a comparatively lesser contribution or popularity after Phase 1
                        are to be given a shoutout at the beginning of Phase 2. Any change in contribution
                        rules will be notified by the organizers in due time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Project Mentors who will be consistently inactive during the 1st Phase
                        will be barred from moving into the 2nd Phase.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Any doubts regarding the event or the contribution life-cycle need to be informed
                        to the organizers at the earliest. Any form of misconduct by the Mentors will not
                        be tolerated. Mentors are also requested to report any incident when the Mentees
                        resort to unethical behaviour or are seen breaking the code of conduct.

                        You must have one or more projects on GitHub with merge access. The project can range
                        from any domain i.e. web or app to something more complex like blockchain and

                    <h6>Boost Your Project</h6>
                    <p>
                        Do you have a project which you had started months ago and now you don't find time to
                        add new features to it or fix small issues? You must apply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the students, it's about the contributions. And for you, it's about keeping your
                        project alive. Do you have an idea in your mind about a small or big utility and
                        want to make it real in December Vacations? You must apply too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You'll have to lay down the groundwork and side-wise can teach a bunch of
                        students about it too.
