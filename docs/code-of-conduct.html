            <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
            <h3>Read the code of conduct carefully!</h3>
            <p>
                Attention all neurotechies of the upcoming Neuroverse coding competition! We want to inform you that the
                prelims will be held on 30 March, 2023 at 1:00 pm in the computer science department. The prelims will
                be a 30 minute multiple-choice question test designed to evaluate your knowledge and skills in coding.
                Only those participants who achieve the qualifying marks in the prelims will be allowed to proceed to
                the final coding competition on 1 April, 2023. The final competition will be a two-hour long competitive
                coding round where you will be expected to showcase your abilities to solve interesting problems.
                Please make sure to arrive at the venue on time and adhere to the rules and regulations set forth by the
                organizing committee. It is important that all participants maintain a respectful and professional
                demeanor towards their fellow competitors and judges throughout the competition.
                The judges' decision will be final and binding, and no appeals will be entertained. We expect all
                participants to compete with honesty, integrity, and sportsmanship, and any violation of the code of
                conduct may lead to disqualification from the competition.
                We wish you the best of luck in your endeavors and look forward to seeing your skills and abilities in
                action!
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Be respectful to others. At some point of time, you may not
                    agree with others that is totally fine, but disagreement should
                    not lead to any personal attack or poor behavior.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Be careful with the words you choose, there are no such strict
                    rules but we expect some level of professionals and you are an
                    adult, you know what not to say.
                </li>

                <li>
                    We donâ€™t encourage either stalking or any kind of personal
                    message to both of the mentors and fellows. <br />
                    If you think someone is violating the code of conduct, we
                    encourage you to report it by mailing us at
